NOTE:
==============
	This is a research code and is developed incrementally. So, it is not
	well organized and also some parts are not relevant. For example: the
	perplexity computation function is incorrect, if you need this then you
	need to modify the code or contact the authors. This code
	is partially commented. Use it at your own risk.
